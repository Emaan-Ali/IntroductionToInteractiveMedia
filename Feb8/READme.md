### A Simple Work of Art

My artwork is inspired by leaves changing colors throughout the year.

I used for() loops to create branches in the background. The x variable increases randomly in a small range giving the effect of different spacing throughout the branches. The y variable also increases randomly and since the opacity of the fill is set to 70, the overlapping squares create more complex shades than just the randomly generated red value.

Next I created several ellipses on the canvas using randomly generated x and y coordinates. Since I wanted the ellipse to be shades of green, I set the green value at 160 while the red and the blue change over a small range.

Since I wanted to portray how the leaves change colors in fall, I set the ellipses to change colors as the mouse is pressed giving the illusion of fall.

#### Problems
1. I found it a bit hard to work with the syntax of for() loops but with the help of the reference page and the tutorial linked in the repository I was able to get a hang of it.
2. Figuring out the range of red and blue values for green shades took a lot of trial and error

#### Interesting things
To paraphrase what Ellsworth Kelly said, my art was not a blind chance; planned, but always surprising.
