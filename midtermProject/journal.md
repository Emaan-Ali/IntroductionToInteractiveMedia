#### ~~Dino~~ <insert funny name<insert funny name>> Game
As someone who never got to play games growing up and only had the leisure of watching my elder sister play, I am terrible at playing computer games. Therefore for this assignment, it was quite challenging for me to think about a game I liked that I could recreate while adding my pizzazz to it.

I got my game idea in one of the most unexpected places. As I accompanied my friend Basil to one of his follow-up appointment at Cleveland Clinic yesterday, I waited for him on the terrace outside, doing my homework, the wifi outside was very spotty and kept disconnecting. All of a sudden the infamous Dino game that's built into the Chrome browser popped up and brought back memories from my childhood, watching my sister play a similar game on our Nintendo.
  
Therefore for this project, I will attempt to recreate the classic dino game while changing the theme a bit to add my touch to it. At the moment, I am unsure of the storyline behind the game but my goal for this week was to test out the basic function and see if it is something I will be able to pull off.
