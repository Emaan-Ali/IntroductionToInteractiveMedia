#### ~~Dino~~ <insert funny name<insert>> Game

As someone who never got to play games growing up and only had the leisure of watching my elder sister play, I am terrible at playing computer games. Therefore for this assignment, it was quite challenging for me to think about a game I liked that I could recreate while adding my pizzazz to it.

I got my game idea in one of the most unexpected places. As I accompanied my friend Basil to one of his follow-up appointment at Cleveland Clinic yesterday, I waited for him on the terrace outside, doing my homework, the wifi outside was very spotty and kept disconnecting. All of a sudden the infamous Dino game that's built into the Chrome browser popped up and brought back memories from my childhood, watching my sister playing a similar game on our Nintendo. Therefore for this project, I will attempt to recreate the classic dino game while changing the theme a bit to add my touch to it.

At the moment, I am unsure of the storyline behind the game but my goal for this week was to test out the basic function and see if it is something I will be able to pull off.
 
  **Potential Challenges**
  
 I believed that making the obstacles move across the screen while randomly generating them would be a bit challenging. Therefore that is the part of the code I wanted to test out first.
  
  I started off with a simple box generation and then tried making it jump by moving the y cordinate up by a a couple of pixels and also generated random obstales and moved them horizontaly across the screen by changing their y cordinate uniformly.
