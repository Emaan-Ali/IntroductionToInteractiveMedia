#### Dino Game
As someone who never got to play games growing up and only had the liesure of watching my elder sister play, I am terrible at playing computer games. Therefore for this assignment it was quite challenging for me to think about a game I liked that I could recreate while adding my own pizzazz to it. I got my game idea in one of the most unexpected places. As I accomapined my friend Basil to one of his follow-up appointment at Clevelnad Clinic yesterday, I waited for him on the terrcae outside, doing my homeowrk, the wifi outside was very spotty and kept disconnecting. All of a sudden the infamous Dino game thats built into the Chrome browser popped up and brought back memories from my childhood of watching my sister play a similar game on our nintendo growing up.

Therefore for this project, I will attempt to recreate the classic dino game while changing the theme a bit to add my own touch to it.
