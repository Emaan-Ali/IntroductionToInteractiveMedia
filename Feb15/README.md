### Object Oriented Programming Generative Art

For my art, I was inspired by the colors and the patters made by light as it refelcts through a diamond.

I decided to portray this by generating multiple triangles using OOP. I used a for() loop to push the traingles into the object array.

The RGB values for the fill were randomly generated while the transperancy is set to 40 to give it a multiple color effect.

The following was my result.

#### Problems Faced
1. I found it a bit hard to work with the syntax of OOP but looking at tutorials linked in the repository helped a lot.
