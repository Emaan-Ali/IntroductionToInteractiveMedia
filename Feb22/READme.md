### Data Visualisation

#### Cryptocurrency Google Trends
For this projects I got the data set representing the popularity of the search word 'crypotocurrency' in the past 5 years.

I then used p5js to visualise this data and plot the points of all the cordinates on the canvas.

#### Problems Faced
1. It was hard to decide on a data set at first but once I made up my mind the process became smoother.
2. The systax was difficult to navigate but the class notes helped a lot.
